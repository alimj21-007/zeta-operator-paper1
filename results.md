# Results

## Eigenvalue Spectra
- Eigenvalues were computed for multiple kernels and parameter values.
- The spectra exhibit clustering patterns reminiscent of zeta zero distributions.

## Convergence Analysis
- Trace and Hilbertâ€“Schmidt norms converge as grid size increases.
- Convergence plots confirm numerical stability.

## Visualizations
- Heatmaps reveal structural differences between kernels.
- Eigenvalue distributions provide insight into operator behavior.

## Tables
- `eigenvalues.csv` and `convergence_metrics.csv` summarize numerical results.
