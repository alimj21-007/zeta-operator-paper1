# Zeta Operator Project Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for the **Zeta Operator Project**.  
This project provides a computational and numerical framework for studying operators inspired by the Riemann zeta function and their spectral analysis.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals
- Define and implement multiple kernels (zeta, Gaussian, exponential)  
- Construct weighted integral operators  
- Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors  
- Analyze convergence metrics (Trace and Hilbertâ€“Schmidt norm)  
- Generate reproducible outputs (CSV, PNG) for research and outreach  
- Ensure reproducibility, modularity, and clear documentation
