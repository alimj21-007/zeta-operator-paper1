# Discussion

Our results demonstrate that kernel-based operators can reproduce spectral patterns with potential relevance to the Riemann zeta function.  

### Key Observations
- Zeta-inspired kernels yield eigenvalue distributions with nontrivial structure.
- Convergence metrics validate the stability of computations.
- Comparisons with Gaussian and exponential kernels highlight unique features of the zeta kernel.

### Limitations
- Numerical experiments are constrained by grid size and computational resources.
- Further theoretical justification is required to connect these operators rigorously to zeta zeros.

### Future Work
- Extend experiments to larger domains and higher precision.
- Explore alternative kernels motivated by analytic number theory.
- Investigate connections with random matrix theory.
