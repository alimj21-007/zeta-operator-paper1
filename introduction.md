# Introduction

The Riemann zeta function occupies a central role in analytic number theory.  
The Riemann Hypothesis, concerning the nontrivial zeros of the zeta function, remains one of the most profound unsolved problems in mathematics.

Spectral approaches to the zeta function suggest that its zeros may correspond to eigenvalues of certain operators.  
This project develops a computational framework to explore such operators, focusing on kernel-based constructions and their spectral properties.

We aim to:
- Define and analyze zeta-inspired kernels
- Construct integral operators
- Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors
- Study convergence metrics
- Provide reproducible outputs for further research
