# Abstract

We present a computational framework for studying spectral operators inspired by the Riemann zeta function.  
Our approach combines kernel-based operator construction, eigenvalue analysis, and convergence metrics to explore connections between operator spectra and zeta zero statistics.  

The pipeline is fully reproducible, modular, and designed for accessibility. Outputs include eigenvalue tables, convergence plots, and kernel visualizations.  
This work contributes to the broader effort of understanding spectral formulations of the Riemann Hypothesis and provides a foundation for reproducible numerical experiments.
