# Draft: Zeta Operator Project

---

## Abstract

We present a computational framework for studying spectral operators inspired by the Riemann zeta function.  
Our approach combines kernel-based operator construction, eigenvalue analysis, and convergence metrics to explore connections between operator spectra and zeta zero statistics.  

The pipeline is fully reproducible, modular, and designed for accessibility. Outputs include eigenvalue tables, convergence plots, and kernel visualizations.  
This work contributes to the broader effort of understanding spectral formulations of the Riemann Hypothesis and provides a foundation for reproducible numerical experiments.

## Introduction

The Riemann zeta function occupies a central role in analytic number theory.  
The Riemann Hypothesis, concerning the nontrivial zeros of the zeta function, remains one of the most profound unsolved problems in mathematics.

Spectral approaches suggest that zeta zeros may correspond to eigenvalues of certain operators.  
This project develops a computational framework to explore such operators, focusing on kernel-based constructions and their spectral properties.

Goals:
- Define and analyze zeta-inspired kernels
- Construct integral operators
- Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors
- Study convergence metrics
- Provide reproducible outputs for further research

## Methods

### Kernel Definitions
We implemented several kernels:
- **Zeta kernel**: motivated by analytic continuation of ζ(s)
- **Gaussian kernel**: for stability and comparison
- **Exponential kernel**: as a test case for decay properties

### Operator Construction
Operators are built by discretizing integral transforms of the form:
\[
(Tf)(x) = \int K(x,y) f(y) \, dy
\]

### Eigenvalue Computation
We compute eigenpairs using numerical linear algebra routines, storing results in CSV format.

### Convergence Metrics
Two metrics are tracked:
- **Trace norm**
- **Hilbert–Schmidt norm**

### Visualization
- Heatmaps of kernel matrices
- Convergence plots across grid sizes

## Results

### Eigenvalue Spectra
- Eigenvalues were computed for multiple kernels and parameter values.
- The spectra exhibit clustering patterns reminiscent of zeta zero distributions.

### Convergence Analysis
- Trace and Hilbert–Schmidt norms converge as grid size increases.
- Convergence plots confirm numerical stability.

### Visualizations
- Heatmaps reveal structural differences between kernels.
- Eigenvalue distributions provide insight into operator behavior.

### Tables
- `eigenvalues.csv` and `convergence_metrics.csv` summarize numerical results.

## Discussion

Our results demonstrate that kernel-based operators can reproduce spectral patterns with potential relevance to the Riemann zeta function.  

**Key Observations**
- Zeta-inspired kernels yield eigenvalue distributions with nontrivial structure.
- Convergence metrics validate the stability of computations.
- Comparisons with Gaussian and exponential kernels highlight unique features of the zeta kernel.

**Limitations**
- Numerical experiments are constrained by grid size and computational resources.
- Further theoretical justification is required to connect these operators rigorously to zeta zeros.

**Future Work**
- Extend experiments to larger domains and higher precision.
- Explore alternative kernels motivated by analytic number theory.
- Investigate connections with random matrix theory.

## Conclusion

We developed a reproducible computational framework for studying spectral operators inspired by the Riemann zeta function.  
Our pipeline integrates kernel construction, operator analysis, eigenvalue computation, and convergence metrics.  

The results suggest intriguing parallels between operator spectra and zeta zero statistics, though further theoretical work is needed.  
This project provides a foundation for future research, emphasizing reproducibility, accessibility, and public engagement.
